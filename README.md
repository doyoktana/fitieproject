# Fitie: Fitness Bestie

Fitie is a machine learning based fitness move prediction. The machine learning will be trained with over 1000 videos of fitness moves. Using a webcam or camera, the machine learning will try to predict what moves are the user trying to do.

## Machine Learning
- Finding dataset about fitness moves. If possible, the dataset is in video form.
- Doing research about video classification.
- Create the python code for preproccessing data.
- Code the feature extraction.
- Create and experimenting the model from the dataset.
- Save and export the model into to .h5 format.
- Deploy the model using Flask.

## Mobile Development
- Create the wireframe using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/sWUdoJZN1ptvlEyabUuiEj/Fitie?node-id=7%3A38&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=7%3A20&show-proto-sidebar=1)

## Deployment
- All deployment files are saved in [deploy folder](https://github.com/doyoktana/fitieproject/tree/main/fitie-ml/deploy).
- Install Flask
- Install TensorFlow
- Install OpenCV
- Run app.py in the deploy folder.
