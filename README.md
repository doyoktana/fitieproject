# Fitie: Fitness Bestie

Fitie is a machine learning based fitness move prediction. The machine learning will be trained with over 1000 videos of fitness moves. Using a webcam or camera, the machine learning will try to predict what moves are the user trying to do.

## Machine Learning
- Finding dataset about fitness moves. If possible, the dataset is in video form.
- Doing research about video classification.
- Create the python code.
- Create model from the dataset.
- Save and export the model into to .h5 format.
- Deploy the model using Flask

## Cloud Computing
- Create Google Cloud Project.
- Create cloud Vertex AI and use Notebook Jupyter. 
- Collect datasets in cloud storage.
- Create a multi-region standard cloud storage bucket.

## Mobile Development
- Create the wireframe using Figma
- 

## Deployment
All deployment files are saved in `fitieproject/fitie-ml/deploy`
