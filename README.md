# Fitie: Fitness Bestie

Fitie is a machine learning based fitness move prediction. The machine learning will be trained with over 1000 videos of fitness moves. Using a webcam or camera, the machine learning will try to predict what moves are the user trying to do.

## Machine learning:
- Finding dataset about fitness moves. If possible, the dataset is in video form.
- Doing research about video classification.
- Create the python code.
- Create model from the dataset.
- Save and export the model into the format that we needed for deployment (either .h5 or .pkl).
